ASSIGNMENT 2: IMAGE COMPRESSION



Goal: The goal of this assignment is to get some practice with linked lists. In this assignment you will use linked lists (actually a list of lists) to encode an image in a compact format and perform operations on this format.




Problem Statement: Imagine a grayscale image of size NxN. Each pixel is either black (0) or white (1). In typical course, this will be represented as a 2D array storing O(N2) values. The idea of the compressed representation is to use the redundancy in the pixel value information among neighboring pixels to reduce the amount of information that needs to be stored. The representation proceeds row-wise and stores the column indices of contiguous segments of black (0) pixels. For example, see the image below:

Its uncompressed representation is as follows (first line is image width and height):

16 16

1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0

1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0

1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1

1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1

1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1

1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1

1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1



Its equivalent compressed representation is:

    16 16

-1

    5 7 -1

    3 7 -1

    2 7 -1

    2 2 6 7 -1

    6 7 -1

    6 7 -1

    4 6 -1

    2 4 -1

    2 3 14 15 -1

    2 2 13 15 -1

    11 13 -1

    11 12 -1

    10 11 -1

    9 10 -1

    7 9 -1
The first line has image width and height respectively. Second line onwards, each line corresponds to image rows (we will number them as 0 to width-1). In each line we store column indices for contiguous segments of black pixels. For example in the line corresponding to row 2 the set of black pixels are from column number 3 to 7. Hence we have 3 7 in the fourth line of the representation. The -1s demarcate the rows. If there are more than 1 contiguous black segments in a row then we store the start and end indices of each segment in order, as for rows 4, 9 and 10.

Your job is to implement the following interface:

public interface compressedImage {

public void compressedImage(String filename);

public void compressedImage(boolean[][] grid, int width, int height);

public boolean getPixelValue(int x, int y) throws pixelOutOfBoundException;

public void setPixelValue(int x, int y, boolean val) throws pixelOutOfBoundException;

public int[] numberOfBlackPixels();

public void invert();

public void performAnd(compressedImage img) throws boundsMismatchException;

public void performOr(compressedImage img) throws boundsMismatchException;

public void performXor(compressedImage img) throws boundsMismatchException;

public String toStringUnCompressed();

public String toStringCompressed();

}

Here, compressedImage constructors may either take in a 2D array of 0s and 1s, or a name of the file that has the same representation written in the textfile. getPixelValue and setPixelValue are operations to access and modify individual pixels. numberOfBlackPixels counts the number of black pixels in each row. Invert method makes each black pixel white and each white pixel black. Boolean operations over images are defined as: for each pixel (i,j), or returns white if any pixel is white, whereas and returns white if both pixels are white. Finally, xor returns white if exactly one of the pixels is white. It also has two methods to convert the current image into a string. The strings should be exactly the representation in either compressed or uncompressed form (including line breaks commas).

Desiderata: Each operation in the input must be processed as efficiently as possible (in terms of time complexity).
